# DIY-Arduino-Incubator
This is a repository for the ongoing "DIY arduino incubator from scratch" series in kaka_tv's channel. Here i will be sharing the hardware files (schematics, pcbs component list and their explanations) as well as source files for the program. 

The main goal of this project is designing a universal incubator that will run on an Arduino nano with as few pre made modules as possible. writing code that will cater to different people in different cities of the world. an easy and repairable incubator that can be set up and run even by a kid. all the while serving as a challenge and teaching us things about electronics and programming. 

This readme or wiki (later) will be in line with the youtube series.

#Episode 5:
I have already kick started designing the schematic for this.

Plan for next video:
Start the software process:
  the objectives of the incubator 
  difficulties in solving thsoe objectives

and ofcourse just start building.

# DIY-Arduino-Incubator
This is a repository for the ongoing "DIY arduino incubator from scratch" series in kaka_tv's channel. Here i will be sharing the hardware files (schematics, pcbs component list and their explanations) as well as source files for the program. 

The main goal of this project is designing a universal incubator that will run on an Arduino nano with as few pre made modules as possible. writing code that will cater to different people in different cities of the world. an easy and repairable incubator that can be set up and run even by a kid. all the while serving as a challenge and teaching us things about electronics and programming. 

This readme or wiki (later) will be in line with the youtube series.

#Episode 5:
I have already kick started designing the schematic for this. 
Schematic link in easyeda: https://easyeda.com/editor#id=|8790f6cc49c243429d678afd4571d37c
Video link: https://youtu.be/of25-rBlspA

Plan for next video:
Start the software process:
  the objectives of the incubator 
  difficulties in solving thsoe objectives

and ofcourse just start building. 
 
#Episode 6:
Just wanted to let the audience know which ide i was using and taught some basics about vscode and github.

#Episode 7:
I wanted to first make the software and see if it ran alright, rather than build and test at the same time. it certainly took alot of time if you take a look at the commit history even after working on this for over a year it still took me quite some time. i think it payed off. i am going to cover all the details about the code. 
unfortunately i won't be able to go into as much basics as i wanted to due to the length and complexity of the code. but i will certainly leave links to the important stuff 
in the description of the video. 

Just merged the dev branch after testing almost all functions. now time to build on that and make it better, prettier and easier to understand. 
I will share my findings from when i was building this project in the video because there is just alot to cover and typing requires too much time. 
Also i haven't really commited properly just because i kept trying different ways to make the code work for almost any sitatuation so regular and correct 
commits were not an option.
